          <!-- I have 3 years of experience in Frontend Web Programming, I have a few
          experiences on Angular and React.js projects, but I work mainly on
          Vue.js/NuxtJS. Previously I work in Desktop Programming for 6 years. I
          can use VB6, VB.Net, SQL server, MySQL, and crystal report. Most of
          the program I work on is about retail and small factory production. -->

          It all started in 2013 after I finished my associate degree. I join a
          software house company called 3PM Solution and worked as Desktop App
          Developer. I work mainly on Visual Basic which I'm pretty sure not
          many developers nowadays even have heard about it (lmao). Since the
          desktop app is not separated by a frontend and backend like a web app,
          I have a requirement to understand SQL queries too. I learn queries
          from databases like SQL Server and PostgreSQL which actually have a
          lot of similarities in between. In this company, I get experience to
          make apps for retail, warehouse, and manufacturing.<br /><br />
          After a few years of wandering around desktop programming, I realized
          that the programming world is already shifting to the web app and
          mobile app, I felt like being left behind (╥﹏╥). Then I got my first
          experience with the web app from an Angular 4 project, it feels like a
          different world to me.<br /><br />
          Since then I fell in love with web app development, I switch my career
          to a Frontend Web Developer and I work mainly on Vue.js and Nuxt.
